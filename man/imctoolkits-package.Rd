While high-dimensional single-cell based Imaging Mass Cytometry data has
demonstrated increased applications in microenvironment composition and
solid tumor research, integrated analyzing workflow design for experimental
cytometry data has been challenging. Here, we present imctoolkits, an R package
designed for the analysis and interpretation of Imaging Mass Cytometry
data. We have applied imctoolkits to well designed compared-groups Imaging Mass Cytometry
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) data to validate the usage and practical utility of its
computational modules. These use cases introduce imctoolkits as a reliable tool
for high-dimensional cytometry data workflow and reveal good performance
on trajectory reconstruction and pseudotime estimation.
